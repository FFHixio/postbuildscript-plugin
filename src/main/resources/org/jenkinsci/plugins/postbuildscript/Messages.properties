PostBuildScript.DeprecatedUsageOfMatrixOptions=This multi-configuration project post-build action was migrated from a plugin version prior to 1.0.0 as an ''Execute Scripts'' post-build action, because is not possible to automatically migrate a post-build action to another kind of post-build action. To remove the mandatory dependency between post-build script plugin and the matrix plugin, there is an extra post-build action called ''Execute Scripts on Matrix''. Please add all post-build scripts of this matrix project separately as a post-build action ''Execute Scripts on Matrix'' and remove all ''Execute Scripts'' entries.
